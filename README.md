# NectarLearning
Nectar Learning

This repository contains files that are used for experiments with bees in a nectar-learning paradigm.

OpenSCAD files are instructions for 3D printing useful experimental pieces. 

Arduino files are used to automatically sense bees' visits to artificial flowers and deliver rewards

Jupyter notebooks are used to communicate with Arduinos to collect data 

# TODO:
1. Write script to run nectar feeders in parallel
2. Merge data together (from both feeders, even though time is not synched)
3. Include video on trials -- maybe wirte a bash script to run the cameras (maybe as a differnt process)
