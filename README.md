Nectar Learning

This repository contains files that are used for experiments with bees in a nectar-learning paradigm.

OpenSCAD files are instructions for 3D printing useful experimental pieces. 

Arduino files are used to automatically sense bees' visits to artificial flowers and deliver rewards

Jupyter notebooks are used to communicate with Arduinos to collect data
